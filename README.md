# DIDI – Drone ID (DID) Initiative

## Purpose

The role of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has evolved into the so-called dual use at an unprecedented scale. What was previously a clear distinction between civil and military applications has now become increasingly vague and unpredictable. This is particularly evident in the case of civil UAVs, more broadly known as drones, which pose emerging threats. In order to protect the assets and infrastructure of nations, we propose an identification protocol – Drone ID (DID) – that makes it possible to determine a drone's origin, extendable with additional properties such as "[friend-or-foe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identification_friend_or_foe)" paradigm.

### Goals

#### Keep the DID protocol open source

This will allow easier adoption across industries and authorities.

#### Stronger guarantees than EU Regulation 2019/947 ([link](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg_impl/2019/947/oj/eng))
Our approach must go beyond the minimal requirements of the existing EU regulation. This ensures higher trust and better alignment with future security interests. 

#### Balanced operational burden
DID should not create excessive cost or complexity for civil users and operators. It becomes a mandatory step in onboarding operator and drone into regional airspace system.
